# Objective

Analyze flip elapsed time of a double pendulum given the initial configuration.

The study of **double pendulums** isn't remotely developed, partly due to the fact there are **no exact solution** to the coupled differential equations, but also due to the randomness of the system. **Data visualization** of a measure of the **randomness** of the double pendulum, the measure being the flip elapsed time, may help organize and search for interesting initial conditions.

## Problem

1. For which initial conditions will the pendulum flip? Not flip?

2. Analyze the points for which the pendulum does not flip outside the energetically-forbidden region (EFR).
